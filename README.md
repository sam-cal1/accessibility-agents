> **AI and automated tools are not perfect.** They miss things, make mistakes, and cannot replace testing with real screen readers and assistive technology. Always verify with VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS, and keyboard-only navigation. This tooling is a helpful starting point, not a substitute for real accessibility testing.

**A community-driven open-source project automating accessibility, efficiency, and productivity through AI-based agents, skills, custom instructions, and prompts.**

A sincere thanks goes out to [Taylor Arndt](https://github.com/taylorarndt) and [Jeff Bishop](https://github.com/jeffreybishop) for leading the charge in building this community project. It started because LLMs consistently forget accessibility - skills get ignored, instructions drift out of context, ARIA gets misused, focus management gets skipped, color contrast fails silently. They got tired of fighting it and built an agent team that will not let it slide. Now we want to make more magic together.

> **We want more contributors!** If you care about making software accessible to blind and low vision users, please consider [submitting a PR](CONTRIBUTING.md). Every improvement to these agents helps developers ship more inclusive software for the people who need it most.

---

## The Problem

AI coding tools generate inaccessible code by default. They forget ARIA rules, skip keyboard navigation, ignore contrast ratios, and produce modals that trap screen reader users. Even with skills and CLAUDE.md instructions, accessibility context gets deprioritized or dropped entirely.

## The Solution

**Accessibility Agents** provides seventy-nine specialized agents across eight teams and five platforms:

- **Web Accessibility team** - agents that enforce WCAG AA standards for web code, including i18n/RTL, WCAG AAA coverage, data visualization, email, media, web components, and performance accessibility
- **Document Accessibility team** - agents for Office (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX), PDF, EPUB, and Markdown accessibility scanning and remediation
- **GitHub Workflow team** - twenty agents that manage repositories, triage issues, review PRs, manage project boards, CI/CD workflows, security alerts, releases, notifications, and wiki pages
- **Developer Tools team** - agents for Python, wxPython, desktop accessibility, NVDA addon development, and accessibility tool building
- **Education & Standards** - screen reader simulation, WCAG 3.0 preview, WCAG AAA auditing
- **Cross-cutting** - CI/CD accessibility pipelines, compliance mapping, accessibility statements, regression detection, and orchestrators that route work across teams

All agents run on:

- **Claude Code** - Agents you invoke directly for accessibility evaluation
- **GitHub Copilot** (VS Code and CLI) - Agents + workspace instructions that ensure accessibility guidance in every conversation
- **Gemini CLI** - Skills-based extension with always-on WCAG AA context via GEMINI.md
- **Codex CLI** - Direct Accessibility Agents skills pack plus optional experimental TOML-based roles for focused accessibility passes
- **MCP Server** - HTTP-based server providing 24 accessibility scanning tools to any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, VS Code, CI/CD pipelines)

## System Requirements

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** To remain current with Accessibility Agents and ensure proper functionality, you **must** keep all tools updated to their latest versions. New platform capabilities, API changes, accessibility features, and bug fixes directly impact agent behavior.

### Required Tools (Latest Versions)

**For GitHub Copilot (VS Code):**

- **VS Code:** Latest stable release and/or VS Code Insiders ([Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- **GitHub Copilot Extension:** Latest version from VS Code Marketplace
- **GitHub Copilot Chat Extension:** Latest version from VS Code Marketplace
- **Node.js:** v18.0.0 or higher (for CLI tools like axe-core)

**For Claude Code:**

- **Claude Code CLI:** Latest version ([Installation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code))
- **Claude Subscription:** Pro, Max, or Team plan

**For Gemini CLI:**

- **Gemini CLI:** Latest version ([Installation](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli))
- **Google AI Studio API Key:** Active key ([Get Started](https://ai.google.dev/))

**Operating Systems:**

- **macOS:** 10.15 (Catalina) or later
- **Windows:** Windows 10/11 with PowerShell 5.1+ (pre-installed)

### Why Version Currency Matters

1. **Platform API Changes** - VS Code Copilot, Claude Code, and other platforms add new capabilities (tool use, context windows, model selection) that agents rely on
2. **Accessibility Features** - New platform features directly improve agent effectiveness (browser tools, screenshot analysis, DOM inspection)
3. **Bug Fixes** - Critical fixes for tool invocation, context handling, and agent orchestration
4. **Security Updates** - Important security patches for API access, authentication, and data handling
5. **WCAG Evolution** - As standards evolve (WCAG 2.2, 3.0), agents update to reflect current best practices

### Keeping Tools Updated

**Automatic Updates (Recommended):**

```bash
# Update the skill itself
gh extension upgrade gh-skill

# Pull latest repository changes when working from source
cd accessibility-agents
git pull origin main
```

**Manual Updates:**

```bash
# Update Accessibility Agents
cd accessibility-agents
git pull origin main

# Update VS Code
# Help → Check for Updates (or auto-updates if enabled in settings)

# Update GitHub Copilot Extensions
# Extensions → @installed → Click update icon next to GitHub Copilot extensions

# Update Claude Code CLI
claude code update

# Update Node.js tools
npm update -g @axe-core/cli
npm update -g pa11y
```

**Version Checks:**

```bash
# Check current versions
code --version                    # VS Code
claude code --version            # Claude Code CLI
node --version                   # Node.js
npm list -g --depth=0            # Global npm packages
```

### Compatibility Note

Accessibility Agents are tested against the **latest stable releases** of all supported platforms. While older versions may work, we cannot guarantee compatibility or support issues arising from outdated tooling. If you encounter unexpected behavior, update all tools before reporting issues.

### VS Code 1.113 Highlights

VS Code 1.113 is currently the most relevant baseline for GitHub Copilot users of this repo. The release added several changes that improve Accessibility Agents workflows directly:

- **MCP across agent types** - MCP servers configured in VS Code now bridge into Copilot CLI and Claude agents, which makes this repo's MCP guidance more consistent across local, CLI, and Claude workflows.
- **Chat Customizations editor** - `Chat: Open Chat Customizations` gives you one place to inspect and manage instructions, prompt files, agents, skills, MCP servers, and plugins.
- **Broader Agent Debug coverage** - Agent Debug Logs now cover Copilot CLI and Claude agent sessions in addition to local sessions.
- **Integrated browser improvements** - local HTTPS testing with self-signed certificates is easier, and browser tab management is better for accessibility testing workflows.
- **Nested subagents** - VS Code now supports nested subagent delegation. For this repo, that is treated as an optional platform capability, not a default architecture choice. We favor explicit coordinator-worker flows and keep nested subagents disabled by default.

Subagent stance for this repo:

- **Reward:** bounded subagents improve specialization, parallel analysis, and audit structure.
- **Risk:** unrestricted or nested subagents can increase duplicate findings, wrong-agent selection, token cost, and debugging complexity.
- **Recommendation:** use explicit, allowlisted specialist delegation; avoid recursive subagent chains unless a workflow is intentionally designed for them.

For official details, see the VS Code 1.113 release notes: `https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_113`.

### Authoritative Sources and Currency

This project bases platform-specific guidance on official vendor documentation and release notes, not secondary summaries.

- VS Code custom agents docs: `https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-agents`
- VS Code prompt files docs: `https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files`
- GitHub Copilot product docs: `https://docs.github.com/copilot`

Attribution policy:

- Platform claims in this repo should cite at least one official source link.
- New behavior tied to a specific release should include the release note URL.
- When settings keys are documented, link to the official settings/docs page where possible.

## Optional Customization

## GitHub Skills Rollout Guides

For the GitHub Skills specification rollout and release-readiness workflows, see:

- docs/guides/GITHUB-SKILLS-CLI-READINESS.md
- docs/guides/SKILLS-RELEASE-READINESS-TEST-PLAN.md
- .github/workflows/skills-cli-readiness.yml
- .github/workflows/skills-release-readiness.yml

### VS Code 1.113 Workflow Tips

If you are using Accessibility Agents in VS Code 1.113, these settings and commands are the most useful starting point:

```json
{
  "chat.useCustomizationsInParentRepositories": true,
  "github.copilot.chat.agentDebugLog.enabled": true,
  "github.copilot.chat.agentDebugLog.fileLogging.enabled": true,
  "chat.imageSupport.enabled": true
}
```

- Run `Chat: Open Chat Customizations` to inspect loaded instructions, agents, skills, MCP servers, and plugins.
- Use `/troubleshoot` when a customization is not loading or an expected tool is missing.
- Keep `chat.subagents.allowInvocationsFromSubagents` disabled unless you are intentionally experimenting with recursive orchestration patterns.

That last point is a repo recommendation, not a VS Code limitation.

### Custom Thinking Phrases (VS Code 1.110+)

**VS Code users:** Personalize the loading text that appears while agents think with accessibility-themed phrases.

**Add to VS Code Settings (settings.json):**

```jsonc
{
  "chat.agent.thinking.phrases": {
    "mode": "append",  // Adds to default phrases
    "phrases": [
      "Checking contrast ratios...",
      "Testing with screen readers...",
      "Verifying keyboard navigation...",
      "Reviewing ARIA patterns...",
      "Scanning for accessibility barriers...",
      "Consulting WCAG 2.2..."
    ]
  }
}
```

**Options:**

- `"mode": "append"` - Adds your phrases to VS Code's default list (recommended)
- `"mode": "replace"` - Only shows your custom phrases

**Why This Matters:**

- Reinforces accessibility focus during agent work
- Reminds team members that accessibility is actively considered
- Optional fun enhancement to make wait time more engaging

**How to Add:**

1. Open VS Code Settings (Ctrl/Cmd + ,)
2. Click "Open Settings (JSON)" icon in top-right
3. Add the `chat.agent.thinking.phrases` setting
4. Reload window (Command Palette → "Developer: Reload Window")

## Quick Start

### 5.0 Installation Direction

Version 5.0.0 moves Accessibility Agents to a GitHub Skills installation flow backed by native Go binaries for setup, health checks, repair, and hook management.

Planned 5.0 flow:

```bash
gh skill install Community-Access/accessibility-agents
gh skill setup Community-Access/accessibility-agents
gh skill health Community-Access/accessibility-agents
```

Important:

- `gh skill install` is the future primary install path.
- The setup tooling is being implemented as native Go binaries, not Node.js scripts.
- Node.js is still required for the MCP server itself, but not for the installer experience.

### Build the 5.0 CLI

If you are contributing to the 5.0 installer transition or preparing release artifacts, install Go and build the native CLI locally.

**Windows:**

```powershell
winget install --id GoLang.Go --exact --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements
go version
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/build-go-cli.ps1
```

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install go
go version
bash scripts/build-go-cli.sh
```

The compiled binaries are written to `go-cli/bin/`. Windows outputs are `.exe` files. macOS outputs are native CLI executables.

GitHub Actions also builds the Go CLI automatically on Windows, macOS, and Linux via [.github/workflows/build-go-cli.yml](.github/workflows/build-go-cli.yml).

5.0+ uses the GitHub Skills / Go CLI path as the supported installer path.

### Install

Use the GitHub Skills installer:

```bash
gh skill install Community-Access/accessibility-agents
```

Then run setup/health/repair utilities as needed:

```bash
gh skill setup Community-Access/accessibility-agents
gh skill health Community-Access/accessibility-agents
gh skill repair Community-Access/accessibility-agents
```

### Uninstall

```bash
gh skill uninstall Community-Access/accessibility-agents
```

If you need manual cleanup details, see [UNINSTALL.md](UNINSTALL.md).

### Legacy Scripts Removed

The legacy script installers were removed in this branch:

`install.ps1`, `install.sh`, `update.ps1`, `update.sh`, `uninstall.ps1`, `uninstall.sh`.

Use `gh skill` commands going forward.

### Safe installation — your files are never overwritten

The setup flow is designed to be additive and non-destructive:

- **Agent files** (`~/.claude/agents/`, `.github/agents/`) - existing files are skipped, not replaced. A message tells you which agents were skipped so you know what you already have.
- **Config files** (`copilot-instructions.md`, `copilot-review-instructions.md`, `copilot-commit-message-instructions.md`) - our content is wrapped in `<!-- a11y-agent-team: start/end -->` markers and merged into your existing file. Your content above and below the markers is always preserved. If the file does not exist, it is created.
- **Asset directories** (`skills/`, `instructions/`, `prompts/`) - copied file-by-file; files that already exist are skipped.
- **Manifest file** (`.a11y-agent-manifest`) - tracks every file we installed. Repair and update flows use this list to ensure they only touch files we own, never user-created agents. When contributors add new agents to the repo, those files are installed on the next setup/repair pass and added to the manifest.

**Updates are equally safe** - maintenance flows never delete user agent files. If a file is not in the manifest (meaning you created it yourself), it will not be modified or removed.

To reinstall a specific agent from scratch, delete it first and rerun setup or repair.

## Post-Install Validation

After installation, run a validation and self-repair pass. This verifies that all installed surfaces are intact, MCP base dependencies are present, and Playwright is functional if installed.

You can also run it manually at any time:

**PowerShell (Windows) — validate only:**

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/repair-install.ps1 -SummaryPath .a11y-agent-team-install-summary.json
```

**PowerShell (Windows) — validate and auto-repair:**

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/repair-install.ps1 -SummaryPath .a11y-agent-team-install-summary.json -Repair
```

**Shell (macOS / Linux / Git Bash) — validate only:**

```bash
bash scripts/repair-install.sh --summary=.a11y-agent-team-install-summary.json --validate-only
```

**Shell (macOS / Linux / Git Bash) — validate and auto-repair:**

```bash
bash scripts/repair-install.sh --summary=.a11y-agent-team-install-summary.json
```

VS Code users can run these via the **Terminal > Run Task** menu: look for the `Repair:` task group.

The repair pass checks and fixes:

- **Destination paths** — every installed surface (Claude, Copilot, Codex, Gemini, MCP) exists on disk
- **MCP base dependencies** — `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `zod` are present; runs `npm install --omit=dev` if missing
- **Playwright** — `playwright-core` is installed; Chromium is functional; re-runs setup if broken
- **Copilot profile root cleanup** — removes stray agent/prompt/instruction files placed directly in VS Code profile roots instead of the expected subdirectories

Findings are appended to the install summary JSON and a separate `.a11y-agent-team-repair-summary.json` is written next to it. See [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) for symptom-specific guidance.

## Install from VS Code Marketplace (Coming Soon)

**GitHub Copilot users (VS Code):** A VS Code extension is in development that will allow one-click install from the Extensions marketplace. Until then, use the **one-liner install** above or the manual steps in [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md).

**What the extension will include:**

- ✅ 59 fully-integrated agents in GitHub Copilot (VS Code and CLI)
- ✅ 18 reusable accessibility skills (WCAG rules, severity scoring, scanning patterns)
- ✅ 106 custom prompts for web audits, document audits, GitHub workflows, and developer tooling
- ✅ 6 workspace instructions (automatic WCAG AA enforcement on every chat)
- ✅ 100% source citation coverage (all agents cite authoritative standards)
- ✅ Auto-update mechanism (new agents and features arrive automatically)

For other platforms (Claude Code, Gemini, Claude Desktop, Codex), see [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md).

## Source Citation Policy

Every agent follows a formal source citation policy. AI giving accessibility advice must be held to a higher standard -- wrong guidance creates real barriers for real people.

- **No source, no claim.** If an agent cannot cite an authoritative source, it explicitly flags the recommendation as experience-based.
- **Inline citations.** Every factual claim includes a link to the source.
- **Six-tier authority hierarchy.** Normative specs (WCAG, ARIA) > Informative guidance > Platform vendor docs > AT vendor docs > Peer-reviewed experts > Government/legal.
- **Machine-readable source registry.** `SOURCE_REGISTRY.json` maps every agent domain to its designated primary authorities.
- **Automated freshness checks.** A weekly GitHub Actions workflow verifies source URLs are still live and opens issues when documentation drifts.

See [CITATION_POLICY.md](.github/agents/CITATION_POLICY.md) for the full policy.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for what is planned, in progress, and shipped. Track individual items on the [roadmap issues board](https://github.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/issues?q=label%3Aroadmap).

## What This Does Not Cover

- Mobile native accessibility (iOS/Android). A separate agent team for that is [planned](https://github.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/issues/8).
- WCAG AAA compliance (agents target AA as the standard). An AAA agent is [planned](https://github.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/issues/12).

## Example Project

The `example/` directory contains a deliberately broken web page with 20+ intentional accessibility violations. Use it to practice with the agents and see how they catch real issues. See the [example README](example/README.md) for details.

## Contributing

This project exists because the community shows up. Every feature in v2.5 -- the NVDA Addon Specialist, the Text Quality Reviewer, the source citation policy, the wxPython screen reader documentation -- started as a community conversation. Not a roadmap item. A real person saying "this is what I need."

Whether you are a developer, accessibility specialist, screen reader user, or just someone who cares about inclusive software - there is a place for you here.

- **Found an agent gap?** [Open an issue](https://github.com/Community-Access/accessibility-agents/issues/new?template=agent_gap.yml) describing what the agent missed or got wrong.
- **Know a pattern we should catch?** Open a PR. Agent files are plain Markdown - no special tooling required.
- **Building for the blind and low vision community?** Your lived experience and domain knowledge are exactly what makes these agents better. We would love your involvement.

See the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full details, guidelines, and how to get started.

## About This Project

**Accessibility Agents** was founded by [Taylor Arndt](https://github.com/taylorarndt) (COO at [Techopolis](https://github.com/techopolis-group)) and [Jeff Bishop](https://github.com/jeffreybishop) because accessibility is how they work, not something bolted on at the end. When AI coding tools consistently failed at accessibility, they built the team they wished existed - and opened it to the world.

This is a community project. The more perspectives, lived experiences, and domain knowledge that go into it, the better it serves the blind and low vision community. If you have ideas, open a discussion. If you have fixes, open a PR. Every contribution matters.
